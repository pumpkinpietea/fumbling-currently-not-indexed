The West Java Provincial Secretary highlighted that 75-85% of livestock waste from dairy farms in Pangalengan and Lembang remains unmanaged and is dumped into the Citarum River, contributing significantly to high E. coli levels and pollution. To address this crisis, the province is partnering with Itenas to implement a new Bio-CNG (compressed natural gas) technology, converting the animal waste into affordable household energy. This waste-to-energy initiative aims to solve the environmental crisis while providing local farmers with gas priced at around Rp 4,000 per kilogram. The Bio-CNG product is significantly cheaper than subsidized LPG, which currently costs approximately Rp 12,000 for a three-kilogram canister.

**Why it matters:** This initiative creates a new domestic market for waste-to-energy technology (Bio-CNG), offering a scalable economic solution for managing agricultural waste and reducing environmental remediation costs. If successful, it will boost the profitability of dairy farmers by lowering their energy operational costs and fostering green development.

Source Region: Indonesia

The Indonesian U-22 National Team’s failure to advance past the group stage in the 2025 SEA Games is being criticized as a failure of policy and governance, not just field performance. Save Our Soccer (SOS) founder Akmal Marhali demanded a total evaluation, specifically questioning the accountability of Zainudin Amali, the team's person-in-charge. Marhali noted that Amali had targeted gold despite acknowledging that the team’s preparation was drastically inadequate, lasting only a few months compared to the three years invested in the successful 2023 campaign. This setback marks the first time Indonesia failed to reach the SEA Games semifinal since 2009, prompting calls for a comprehensive, honest review of the entire management structure.

**Why it matters:** Major sporting failures can negatively impact corporate sponsorships, marketing opportunities, and the overall commercial value of national sports programs. Inconsistent policy direction hinders long-term investment in talent development and infrastructure, potentially eroding future business revenues tied to Indonesian football.

This follows other reporting on Indonesia's historical claims to maritime sovereignty.

**Why it matters:** Changes in regional maritime or trade regulations could significantly impact international shipping routes, resource exploitation rights (oil, gas, fishing), and supply chain logistics across Southeast Asia and Australia.

### 🇮🇩 Freedom Flotilla Rencanakan Kembali Pelayaran Menembus Blokade Gaza |Republika Online {#freedom-flotilla-rencanakan-kembali-pelayaran-menembus-bloka}

Source Region: Indonesia

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) announced plans for a large-scale international maritime mission in 2026 aimed at breaking the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip and delivering humanitarian aid. The decision follows a recent meeting in Dublin, driven by frustration over the failure of international authorities and ceasefires to end the crisis in Gaza. FFC members stated the mission is intended as a concrete declaration of global civilian protest against countries that have failed to uphold international law and ensure aid access. The coalition criticized UN Security Council Resolution 2803 for allegedly adopting unilateral plans and undermining Palestinian rights, vowing to deploy more ships for the next mission.

**Why it matters:** Renewed direct action like the Flotilla increases geopolitical tension in the Eastern Mediterranean, potentially affecting international shipping routes, insurance costs, and energy supplies in the region. Prolonged conflict and instability in Gaza continue to disrupt reconstruction plans and limit potential international business and investment.

**Confidence:** high
