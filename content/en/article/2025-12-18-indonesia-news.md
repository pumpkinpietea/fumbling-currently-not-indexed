Source Region: International

The arrests mark the first since police announced their intent to crack down on public calls to "globalise the Intifada."

Critics argue that the Arabic word "intifada" means "shaking off or uprising against injustice" and refers to civil uprising against military occupation.

**Why it matters:** The arrests highlight the tension between freedom of speech and concerns about inciting violence in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, potentially impacting future protests and political discourse.
