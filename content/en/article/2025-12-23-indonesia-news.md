### 🇮🇩 Penerapan EPR Dinilai Berpotensi Percepat Pengentasan Kemiskinan Nasional |Republika Online {#penerapan-epr-dinilai-berpotensi-percepat-pengentasan-kemisk}

Source Region: Indonesia

The implementation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is considered to have great potential to contribute to accelerating poverty reduction in Indonesia. This can be achieved through strengthening the informal sector, which has been the backbone of the circular economy ecosystem. The government aims to eliminate extreme poverty by 2026 and reduce the national poverty rate to 4-5% by 2029. The involvement of the private sector is considered crucial, not only through producer obligations but also through corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs.

**Why it matters:** EPR implementation could significantly impact businesses by requiring them to take greater responsibility for the waste generated from their products, potentially leading to increased costs and the need for innovative waste management solutions.

### 🌍 Indonesia tightens second-hand clothing import ban, hitting sellers and thrifty shoppers {#indonesia-tightens-second-hand-clothing-import-ban-hitting-s}

Source: [channelnewsasia.com/…/indonesia-secondhand-clothes-…](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-secondhand-clothes-used-trade-ban-textile-industry-jobs-5672701)

Source Region: International

Indonesia is stepping up enforcement of its ban on second-hand clothing imports, threatening the country’s thrifting trade. The move aims to address economic and health concerns, but sellers face an uncertain future and buyers lose access to affordable fashion. While Indonesia officially banned such imports in 2022, enforcement has been inconsistent. Authorities have warned of strict action against illegal importers and ordered online thrift stores to shut down.

**Why it matters:** The ban could impact the livelihoods of sellers and access to affordable clothing for consumers, while also potentially affecting the domestic textile industry.

Source Region: International

Tesla's electric car sales fell across Europe again last month, with registrations tumbling by 34.2% in the European Union year-on-year in November. The company has faced increased competition from rivals including China’s BYD, who had a strong November with sales growth of 221%. The overall electric car market grew, accounting for 16.9% of the EU market share in the first 11 months of 2025. Copper hit a fresh all-time high above $12,000 a ton in London trading, driven by supply disruptions and a bullish demand outlook.

**Why it matters:** Tesla's declining sales and BYD's surge indicate a shift in the European electric car market, while the rising copper price reflects strong demand for infrastructure and energy networks.

Source Region: Indonesia

The Attorney General's Office (Kejagung) has refused to hand over the investigation of the Petral corruption case to the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). The Jampidsus investigation team is continuing the investigation related to the export-import and management of crude oil and refinery products at the former subsidiary of PT Pertamina. Jampidsus examined former Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) Sudirman Said in connection with the case. The KPK had requested the case in November 2025, but the Attorney General's Office declined, fearing the case would be shelved.
