Heart attacks in women often present with subtle symptoms resembling stress, flu, or indigestion, leading to delayed medical attention. Common signs include pain in the jaw, neck, or shoulder, often mistaken for muscle stress.

These "silent heart attack" symptoms require increased awareness to ensure timely intervention and reduce mortality rates.

**Why it matters:** Increased awareness of these subtle symptoms can lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of heart attacks in women, potentially saving lives. This information can be used to educate the public and healthcare professionals about the unique presentation of heart disease in women.
