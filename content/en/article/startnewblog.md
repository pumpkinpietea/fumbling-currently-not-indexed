### About This Blog

This blog is a migration from my previous site.
The previous URL was https://pumpkinpie-tea.blogspot.com/

### Purpose of the Migration

There were several reasons for migrating this site, primarily to experiment with the following technical aspects:

- Setting up a website with a custom domain
- Configuring and optimizing Google Analytics (GA) and SEO
- Building a website using a static site generator (Hugo)
- Hosting the site using Firebase Hosting

It serves as a personal notepad, where I document my thoughts, experiments, and learning process. It's a space for me to organize ideas and explore new technologies.
