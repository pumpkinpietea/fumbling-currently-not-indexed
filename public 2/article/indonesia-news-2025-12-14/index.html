The decision follows a recent meeting in Dublin, driven by frustration over the failure of international authorities and ceasefires to end the crisis in Gaza. FFC members stated the mission is intended as a concrete declaration of global civilian protest against countries that have failed to uphold international law and ensure aid access. The coalition criticized UN Security Council Resolution 2803 for allegedly adopting unilateral plans and undermining Palestinian rights, vowing to deploy more ships for the next mission.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Renewed direct action like the Flotilla increases geopolitical tension in the Eastern Mediterranean, potentially affecting international shipping routes, insurance costs, and energy supplies in the region.
